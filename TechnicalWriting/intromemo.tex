\begin{memo}

While creating the contents of this portfolio, I attempted to focus on creating personally practical applications of the content.  As a result, I chose to create needed documentation for a software project named Kobby that I have been working on for some time.  In doing this I was able to not only hone my skills as a technical writer, but also create intrisic motivation for my work.

In my technical description of Kobby I attempted to address a somewhat technologically informed audience of the major features in the editor.  My goal in this was to give the audince an idea of what collaborative editing is, and how this software solves some of the problems editors inherently face.  Using this, users could hopefully recognize what Kobby does and does not do without having to explore the application for themselves.

While creating the Kobby Collaborative Document Editing instructions I hoped to introduce a slightly technologically informed audience on the methods to begin using the Kobby editor to collaboratively edit documents.
